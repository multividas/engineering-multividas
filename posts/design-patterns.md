# Creational design pattern

**Creation Design Pattern** focuses on the process of object creation, ensuring that objects are created in a manner suitable to our project requirements. It helps abstract the instantiation logic from the client code.

- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

# Structural design pattern

**Structural Design Patterns** focus on how objects and classes are arranged or composed.

- **Adapter:** Converts one interface into another expected by clients, enabling incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge:** Separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.
- **Facade:** Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use and interact with.

# Behavioral design pattern

**Behavioral Design Pattern** (objects behavior) focus on how objects interact and collaborate to fulfill their responsibilities. They define patterns for managing algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects.
