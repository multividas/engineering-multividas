# Facade design pattern

The **Facade** is a structural design pattern provides a simplified, `unified interface` to a complex system or set of subsystems. It hides the complexity of the system by exposing only essential methods, making it easier for clients to interact with the system.

Key features:

- **Simplifies interfaces:** Offers a straightforward interface to a complex set of classes, making it easier to use.
- **Decouples clients:** Reduces dependencies between the client and the complex subsystem.

- Client has to interact with a large number of interfaces and classes in a subsystem to get result. So client gets tighly coupled with those interfaces and classes. Facade solves this problem.

- Facade is NOT just a one to one method forwarding to other classes.

## How to implement Facade

To implement a Facade class:

- **Identify Subsystems:** Determine the complex subsystems or classes that the facade will simplify. These are typically classes with complex interactions or multiple methods.

- **Create the Facade Class:** Design a facade class that provides a simplified and unified interface to these subsystems.

- **Include Subsystem Instances:** In the facade class, include instances of the subsystem classes. These can be injected via the constructor or created directly within the facade.

- **Implement Simplified Methods:** Add methods in the facade class that internally call the appropriate methods of the subsystem classes.

- **Expose the Facade:** Use the facade class in your client code to interact with the subsystems through the simplified interface.

## Creating Facade class

### Create the Subsystem or Service Class:

This class handles the actual logic that will be abstracted by the facade.

```php
interface ApiRepositoryInterface
{
  public function showAll(Collection $collection, int $code = 200): JsonResponse;

  public function showOne(Model $instance, int $code = 200): JsonResponse;
}
```

### Bind the Service to the Service Container

Bind the service class to Laravel's service container via a service provider.

```php
class ApiResponserServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
  public function register(): void
  {
    $this->app->bind(ApiRepositoryInterface::class, function () {
      return new ApiRepository();
    });
  }
}
```

Now, register the service provider in config/app.php.

```php
// config/app.php

'providers' => [
  // Other Service Providers
  \Multividas\ApiResponser\Providers\ApiResponserServiceProvider::class,
],
```

### Create the Facade Class:

Create the facade class that extends Laravel's Facade class and implements the simplified interface.

```php
class ApiResponser extends Facade
{
  protected static function getFacadeAccessor(): string
  {
    return ApiRepositoryInterface::class;
  }
}
```

### Register the Facade Alias:

Optionally, add the facade alias in the config/app.php file for easy access.

```php
// config/app.php
use Multividas\ApiResponser\Facades\ApiResponser as ApiResponserFacade;

'aliases' => [
  // Other Facade Aliases
  'ApiResponser' => ApiResponserFacade::class,
],
```

### Use the Facade in Controller or Anywhere

Using the `ApiResponser` facade to access the methods of `ApiRepositoryInterface` in your controller.

```php
use Multividas\ApiResponser\Facades\ApiResponser;

class PostsController
{
  public function index(): JsonResponse
  {
    return ApiResponser::showAll(Post::all());
  }

  public function show(string $postId): JsonResponse
  {
    $post = Post::find($postId);

    if (!$post instanceof Post) {
      return $this->infoResponse('Post Not Found', 404, (object)[]);
    }

    return ApiResponser::showOne($post);
  }
}
```

**Simplified interface:** The `ApiResponser` facade provides a clean and easy-to-use interface for interacting with the methods of `ApiRepositoryInterface` (like `showAll()` and `showOne()`), hiding the complexity of its underlying implementation.

**Static access:** With the facade, you're able to access the methods of the underlying `ApiRepositoryInterface` via static calls (`ApiResponser::showAll()`, etc.), without worrying about dependency injection or object instantiation in the controller.

**Encapsulation:** The facade hides the logic of how the `ApiRepositoryInterface` is resolved, providing a layer of abstraction.

### Conclusion:

- **Subsystem:** `ApiRepository` and `ApiRepositoryInterface` does the actual work (structuring and generating API responses).
- **Facade:** `ApiResponser` facade provides a simplified interface for interacting with the `ApiRepositoryInterface`.
- **Client:** The controller (or other parts of the app) can use the `ApiResponser` facade to perform tasks without directly instantiating or interacting with the service.

## Conclusion

As software engineers, we use design patterns daily, this improves readability and lower maintenance cost. **Facade Design Pattern** provides a simplified, `unified interface` to a complex system or set of subsystems
