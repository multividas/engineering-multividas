# Deep Learning TensorFlow

## Scalar ?!

`Scalar` is single, simple value that holds one piece of data.
It refers to basic data types (int, `float`, `string`, `bool`)
It can be a number, string, or boolean.(e.g.,` 5,3.145,3.14`).
Opposed to complex structures like arrays or objects, without direction, unlike vectors

## Vector ?!

`Vector` ordered collection (or array) of values, list of scalars, typically numbers.
It is a 1D structure that can hold multiple values
In machine learning, vectors are used to represent a set of features (input data)

For expl; you can represent a user with various features such as username, email, and location ... (scalar values) as a vector

- `Username`: "soulaimane" (string → encoded to a scalar value)
- `Email`: "soulaimane@yahya.com" (string → encoded to a scalar value)
- `Location`: "Morocco" (string → encoded to a scalar value)

```py
userVector = [
    encodedUsername,
    encodedEmail,
    encodedLocation
]
```

vector becomes:

```py
userVector = [
    1288,
    2228,
    3838
]
```

In a `machine learning model`, these values would typically be processed and encoded (e.g., categorical encoding for text), but as a simple representation, they can be organized as a vector.

## Tensor ?!

`Tensor` is multi-dimensional array of numbers
It generalizes scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions (2D, 3D, etc.).
(e.g., a matrix `[[1,2],[3,4]][[1,2],[3,4]]` or higher dimensions).

A tensor can represent complex data such as:

- A single number (scalar) → 0D tensor
- A list of numbers (vector) → 1D tensor
- A table of numbers (matrix) → 2D tensor
- Higher-dimensional data (like a batch of images) → 3D tensor or more

For expl; Suppose we have a batch of 2 images. Each image is 3x3 pixels, and the pixel values are just numbers between 0 and 255 (grayscale intensity).

```py
img1 = [
    [255, 0, 128],
    [64, 255, 0],
    [0, 128, 255]
]

img2 = [
    [128, 255, 0],
    [0, 64, 255],
    [255, 0, 128]
]

# The 3D tensor will represent both imgs
tensor = [
    img1,  # First img (3x3)
    img2   # Second img (3x3)
]

# Shape of the tensor: (2, 3, 3) - 2 imgs, each 3x3 pixels
```

#### Visualizing Tensor Shape:

The shape of the tensor is `(2, 3, 3)`:

2 → number of images
3 → number of rows in each image
3 → number of columns in each image

In simpler terms;

We're going to be turn Data inputs into a numerical encoding, in other words Tensors, Neural network is then going to figure out different patterns in these numbers and then it's going to output another Tensors, And then we take this tensors, the representation outputs from our Neural network and convert them into something that we can understand.
