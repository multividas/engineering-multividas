# Domain Name System (DNS): Architecture, Operation, and Security

# Shortly, what is DNS resolution?

Domain Name System (DNS) resolution, is the process by which domain names are translated into IP addresses. When you type a website's domain name into a web browser, such as "**multichat.network**" your computer needs to know the corresponding IP address to establish a connection with the website's server.

# Importance of DNS in Networking !

DNS in Networking is `crucial` because it enables easy access to websites by converting domain names into IP addresses

- ensuring reliable and efficient routing of internet traffic

Without DNS, users would need to remember numerical IP addresses to access websites.

### DNS Security Issues:

- **DNS Spoofing**: Attackers inject false DNS responses to redirect traffic.
- **DNS Cache Poisoning**: Malicious data is stored in DNS cache, causing incorrect IP address resolution.
- **DNS Amplification Attacks**: Exploiting DNS servers to launch DDoS attacks.
- **Domain Hijacking**: Gaining unauthorized control over domain registration.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Intercepting DNS queries and responses to steal sensitive data.

# How DNS resolution works:

# Request Initiation

When you enter a domain name (e.g., **multichat.network**) in your web browser, your computer sends a DNS resolution request to a `DNS resolver`.
The resolver can be;

- Internet Service Provider's (ISP)
- DNS server
- third-party DNS resolvers like Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS or OpenDNS (cisco)…

# Recursive Query

The `DNS resolver` receives the request and starts the resolution process. If the resolver doesn't already have the IP address corresponding to the domain name in its **cache**, it begins a `recursive query`.
