# Ansible & AWX

**Ansible AWX** is an open-source web-based UI, API, and management tool for Ansible. It serves as the upstream project for Ansible Tower, which is the enterprise version.

Key features include:

- Web UI and API for managing Ansible.
- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- Scheduling automation tasks.
- Real-time job status and logs.
- Integration with external credential stores and SCM (e.g., Git).

It is ideal for teams looking for a collaborative and scalable way to leverage Ansible.
